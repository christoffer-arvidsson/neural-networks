#+TITLE: Readme

These are some implemetations of neural network models part of the /Artificial
Neural Network/ course at Chalmers.

Models:
- Hopfield network :: A recurrent network that can learn simple patterns.
- Restricted Boltzmann machine :: Precursor to perceptron, it fits the data distribution via Monte Carlo simulation.
- Perceptron :: Simple feed-forward network that uses Stochastic gradient descent.
