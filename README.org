#+title: Implementation of a Hopfield network

An implementation of hopfield networks, taught in an /artificial neural networks/ course at Chalmers.

There are also a few notebooks that were the homework problems.
- Recognising digits :: Store images of digits in network, feed distorted and check what it converges to
- One-step error probability :: Estimate the probability of performing a wrong update, assuming fed pattern is already correct
- Stochastic hopfield network :: Hopfield network with added noise, computes the order parameter
