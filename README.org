#+TITLE: Artificial netual networks

These are some implemetations of neural network models part of the /Artificial
Neural Network/ course at Chalmers.

* Models
- Hopfield network :: A recurrent network that can learn simple patterns.
- Restricted Boltzmann machine :: Precursor to perceptron, it fits the data distribution via Monte Carlo simulation.
- Perceptron :: Simple feed-forward network that uses Stochastic gradient descent.
- Autoendoder :: An autoencoder trained on the MNIST dataset (though very small bottleleck!)
- Reservoir computer :: Model for predicting the continuation time series of Lorent's system
- Convolutional network :: Typical conv net trained on the MNIST dataset
- Q learning :: Simple agent that uses a q table (no deepQ here) for playing tic tac toe
